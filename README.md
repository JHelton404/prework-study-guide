# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description
This website is an exercise in coding that will prepare us as students to learn the basics of coding and prepare us for our classes. I am excited for the possibility of learning and discovering how computers function. And I am excited to be capable of understanding computers so that I can take control myself. My goals are to further my own career path and become a software developer. Perhaps even a web designer. This website is the first complete project I have made as a student. And even though it was a guided effort, I am expecting the tools I was given here will help me to excel going forward.


- What was your motivation?
This is a basic website that I have created for the upcoming University of Minnesota online coding bootcamp. I'm motivated to expand my career options and join the league of software developers throughout the world.


- Why did you build this project?
This website is an early example of what can be done with software development. Soon, I may become a professional software developer and web designer, capable of creating much more complex designs than what is seen here.


- What problem does it solve?
This project enables us as bootcamp students to prepare all necessary applications and programs prior to the classes start. To ensure we are prepared for the upcoming lectures and are ready to excel.


- What did you learn?
 I've already learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JS through this exercise. And the website demonstrates that I am capable of doing such tasks.

## Usage
If I were to get the most use out of this website, I would try and treat it as a basic entry tool to understanding coding. Firstly, there are some basic notes describing what each of the topics can do. Four tools are described briefly here: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. But there's a bit more behind the surface.

If you are on a Windows PC, while on the website press and hold the following keys on your keyboard: Control + Shift + I. Or if you are on an Apple Macintosh, press the following keys: Command + Shift + I.

That should bring up the Inspect menu on the right-hand side of your screen. This menu might look confusing and scary at first, but that's alright! It shows everything that's running behind-the-scenes for the website while you browse. And is actually accessible on every website you go to while on the web. If you are on a chrome-based browser (which most browsers are besides Firefox), then you should be able to follow along to see the code in action.

Don't worry about messing anything up, if you simply refresh the page then the website should go back to its default setting. I'll give you some instructions on some things the code can do.

Elements: Click on the elements tab of the Insepct menu we just brought up. There should be some blue text written there. Take a look at the third line from the top, the one that reads <head>...</head>. Go ahead and double-click on that line. Some more text should appear. This text defines what you can see on the web page. Go to the last line of the header section with the text, <title>Prework Study Guide</title>. You should be able to see that the words, "Prework Study Guide" are in white. You should be able to click on and highlight that text and then type to change it. Go ahead and change it to whatever you like, I suggest typing "Hello World!". And once that is done go ahead and click on the web page itself again to lock the change in. What changed? Did you see it? If not, take a look at tab for this webpage on top of the browser. It should reflect what you typed in the title! This is how HTML is most often used. It informs the website what information should be displayed at any given time.

Console: Now go to the Console tab of the Element menu. I've set it up so that it contains a function. It defines the topics we learn through the class prework, as well as gives a suggestion for what topic we should start studying. If you refresh the page a few times, you'll notice that the last line can change. This is because I have set it to select one of the four topics at random. These functions are what JavaScript is often used for. You can see them in action as you refresh the page with the Console open.

Sources: Now go to the Sources tab of the Element menu. You should see a folder called "assets". Go ahead and click it to open it. And a new file called "style.css" should appear. Click on "style.css" to open it. You should be able to see some code appear just to the right. Now take a look at line 10. You should have noticed immediately when opening the website that the site itself has a blue header and footer. But not everyone may like blue as a color for the header and may prefer something else. You may prefer red, or green, or perhaps a different shade of blue. Go ahead and click on the small box to the left of the word blue. This should open the color picker. Why don't you pick your favorite color? If you select any one of the colors, you should see an immediate change on the website. The color will change to what you select! This is what CSS is typicall used for, it is used to give the website its sense of style. Feel free to pick your favorite color.

This demonstration should give you some idea of how code effects the website. And can give you a quick glance of how coding works in website design. Hopefully this guide was easy to follow along
