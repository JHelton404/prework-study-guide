# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description
This website is an exercise in coding that will prepare us as students to learn the basics of coding and prepare us for our classes. I am excited for the possibility of learning and discovering how computers function. And I am excited to be capable of understanding computers so that I can take control myself. My goals are to further my own career path and become a software developer. Perhaps even a web designer. This website is the first complete project I have made as a student. And even though it was a guided effort, I am expecting the tools I was given here will help me to excel going forward.


- What was your motivation?
This is a basic website that I have created for the upcoming University of Minnesota online coding bootcamp. I'm motivated to expand my career options and join the league of software developers throughout the world.


- Why did you build this project?
This website is an early example of what can be done with software development. Soon, I may become a professional software developer and web designer, capable of creating much more complex designs than what is seen here.


- What problem does it solve?
This project enables us as bootcamp students to prepare all necessary applications and programs prior to the classes start. To ensure we are prepared for the upcoming lectures and are ready to excel.


- What did you learn?
 I've already learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JS through this exercise. And the website demonstrates that I am capable of doing such tasks.

## Usage
If I were to get the most use out of this website, I would try and treat it as a basic entry tool to understanding coding. Firstly, there are some basic notes describing what each of the topics can do. Four tools are described briefly here: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. But there's a bit more behind the surface.


If you are on a Windows PC, while on the website press and hold the following keys on your keyboard: Control + Shift + I. Or if you are on an Apple Macintosh, press the following keys: Command + Shift + I


That should bring up the Inspect menu on the right-hand side of your screen. This menu might look confusing and scary at first, but that's alright! It shows everything that's running behind-the-scenes for the website while you browse. And is actually accessible on every website you go to while on the web.


If you are on a Chrome-based browser (which includes most browsers other than Firefox), you should be able to see a tab on top of the Inspect menu that is labeled "Elements". Navigate to that tab if you aren't there already by clicking it with your mouse. This should drop a short bit of text in blue. That blue text actually controls what you can see on the page! Let me demonstrate how it might work. If you're using a Chrome-based browser you can follow along easily.


Find and double-click on the part of the code that says <head>, this should be the third line from the top of the Inspect Elements tab.


A list of new information should drop down from there that shows bits of how the header is coded.


Find the element line that says <title>Prework Study Guide</title>, it should be near the bottom of the header section, just before </head>


The words "Prework Study Guide" are in white. If you'd like you can change what those words say! I might suggest typing, "Hello World!" in to replace those words. Then simply click on the screen.


Did you notice the change? If not at first, that's okay. But I'll give you a hint: check what your tab is titled across the top of the web browser. It should repeat what words you typed into the element!


There are other things you can change and alter on this website through this feature. But here's one more thing that can be a bit more fun. The header and footer of this website are both blue. And blue is a good enough color for me, but I bet some people don't like the color blue and may even prefer red or green. Or maybe they like blue, but not THAT shade of blue. That's okay, I'll help you out.


At the top of the Inspect Menu you'll see some other tabs. Go to the one that says "Sources" by clicking on it. You'll see some computer files and other things there. But you should look at the one that says "Assets". Go ahead and double-click Assets, then click on the file that says, "Style.CSS". CSS is what we use to create style for the websites we make. Just like the color blue that's there. In fact on line 10 of this file, you should be able to see some text saying, "background color" with the color blue to the right of it. Hover your mouse over it and you should be able to change the color of the header/footer in real time. Feel free to pick your favorite! And feel free to explore what else you can change on the website as well.


But what if I break something by accident? Don't worry, the source code of the website won't change. Just refresh the page by hitting F5 on your keyboard or by finding the option on your browser and it'll all go back to normal. I've actually added a function you might notice in the Inspect Menu using JavaScript. JavaScript is what gives code some functionality. And there's a small function visible in the tab that says "Console". Click it and you'll see some text that's hopefully a lot less confusing than what you saw earlier in the elements. In that section you'll see a question asking, "What should we study?" on the second to last line of the Console. And the last line is the answer! If you refresh the page, it's designed to give you a random answer to study the topics you see above.
